# Search index

## üîç What Is a Free-Text Search Index?

A **free-text search index** allows users to search unstructured text (like articles, documents, logs, etc.) using arbitrary queries. Think: how search works in Google Docs, Jira, or even Stack Overflow.

Instead of scanning the entire dataset every time (which would be slow), we build an **index** that makes searches fast and flexible.

## Underlying Data Structures

### Inverted Index (Core Structure)

This is the heart of most text search engines.

- **What it does:** Maps each term (word) to a list of documents (or positions) where it appears.
- **Structure:**
  ```json
  {
    "engineer": [doc1, doc3],
    "search": [doc1, doc2],
    "index": [doc1, doc2, doc3]
  }
  ```
- Often includes positions, term frequency, etc.

### Tokenizer & Analyzer Pipeline

Before building the index, text is preprocessed:

- **Tokenizer** breaks text into words.
- **Normalizer** lowercases, removes punctuation, etc.
- **Stemming/Lemmatization** reduces words to their root form (e.g., "searching" ‚Üí "search").
- **Stop Word Removal** gets rid of common words (like ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúand‚Äù).

### Document Store

Stores the raw or semi-structured documents so you can retrieve full results (titles, snippets, etc.).

### **Optional: Trie, FST (Finite State Transducers)**

Used for **autocomplete**, **prefix/suffix queries**, or **fuzzy matching** (e.g., Elasticsearch does this).

## üîê Security Considerations

### MVP-level (Minimal)

- Basic access control: Only let authenticated users search.
- Maybe field-based filtering (e.g., restrict to your own documents).

### üõ°Ô∏è Advanced

- **Row-level security**: Only show search results user is authorized to see.
- **Field-level redaction**: Hide parts of documents based on user role.
- **Multi-tenancy**: Keep tenants' data separate, especially in SaaS contexts.
- **Audit Logging**: Track what users searched for and what was returned.

## üåç Language & Locale Support

### Basic (MVP)

- Tokenizer for English, basic stemming.

### Advanced

- Support for dozens of languages with:
  - Locale-aware tokenization
  - Language-specific stemming
  - Synonyms & multilingual queries
  - Unicode normalization
  - Language detection per document/query

### NLP integration:

- Named entity recognition
- Semantic search (vector embeddings)
- Query expansion using ontologies

## MVP-Level Free-Text Search

**Tech stack**: SQLite + a simple tokenizer + inverted index

Features:

- Tokenization
- Basic inverted index
- Stop word removal
- Simple matching (AND/OR)

Great for: local apps, logs, small tools, notebooks.

## Full-Featured Search Engine (e.g., Elasticsearch, Solr, OpenSearch)

Includes:

- Distributed indexing
- Full-text + structured querying
- Scoring & ranking (TF-IDF, BM25)
- Faceting, filters, aggregations
- Shards, replicas, fault tolerance
- Fuzzy, wildcard, regex, proximity queries
- Query DSL
- Role-based access, field-level security
- Vector-based semantic search
- Relevance tuning (boosting, synonyms, learning-to-rank)
