## Details per Language

### **Python**

- **CUDA**: Use `CuPy`, `numba.cuda`, or TensorFlow with GPU.
- **DS/ML**: King of the hill ‚Äì pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, matplotlib, etc.
- **Verdict**: Best if you want quick access to data science and GPU with minimal setup.

---

### **C/C++**

- **CUDA**: Direct access. CUDA is written in C/C++.
- **DS/ML**: Not super convenient, but great for integrating with ML backends like PyTorch, TensorFlow.
- **Verdict**: Ideal for performance-critical language design with GPU features.

---

### **Rust**

- **CUDA**: Use `cust`, `rust-cuda`, or interop with C. Early stage but works.
- **DS/ML**: Crates like `ndarray`, `tch-rs` (PyTorch bindings), but not as rich as Python.
- **Verdict**: Great for building performant interpreters with GPU support, though DS is still emerging.

---

### **Haskell**

- **CUDA**: `accelerate` library offers GPGPU support, but niche.
- **DS/ML**: Sparse ‚Äì some linear algebra, but not mainstream.
- **Verdict**: Elegant but not a go-to for data science or GPU unless you're deep into functional stacks.

---

### **Java/Kotlin**

- **CUDA**: Via ND4J, DeepLearning4J, or JCuda (Java bindings for CUDA).
- **DS/ML**: Decent ecosystem for JVM ‚Äì Weka, Smile, DL4J.
- **Verdict**: Not as friendly as Python, but solid for JVM-based data science or deep learning.

---

### **Scala**

- **CUDA**: Through JVM interop.
- **DS/ML**: Spark MLlib, Breeze for math, and works with Java ML libraries.
- **Verdict**: Great for big data; less ideal for low-level GPU work.

### **Go (Golang)**

- **CUDA**: No native CUDA support, but some options:
  - Can call C/C++ CUDA code via `cgo`
  - Libraries like `gocudnn` or wrappers for CuDNN exist, but are niche
- **Data Science**: Early stage
  - Libraries like `gonum`, `golearn` for basic ML
  - No deep learning frameworks like PyTorch/TensorFlow
- **Verdict**: Great for concurrency and systems, not ideal for GPU/DS-heavy DSLs unless integrating with C/C++.

üîß Use Go if:

- You want to build a fast, concurrent language runtime
- You don't need heavy ML/GPU built in

---

### **TypeScript (and JavaScript)**

- **CUDA**: ‚ùå No native CUDA (runs in browser or Node.js)
  - Some browser-based GPU options via WebGL or **WebGPU**
  - Libraries like [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) can run on GPU in the browser
- **Data Science**:
  - TS/JS wrappers for ML: `TensorFlow.js`, `ml5.js`, `brain.js`, `scikit.js` (a Python-like wrapper)
  - Can do decent math, viz, ML in the browser or Node
- **Verdict**: Very solid for lightweight scripting languages with web-based ML, not ideal for low-level GPU work.

üîß Use TypeScript if:

- You're building a language that runs in the browser
- You want portable DS/ML (especially for educational or web tools)
