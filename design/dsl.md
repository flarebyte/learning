## Phases
Managing a script evaluator involves multiple phases to process and execute code effectively. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of the key phases:

###  Lexical Analysis (Tokenization)
   - Purpose: Converts raw script text into a sequence of tokens (words, numbers, symbols).
   - Components: Tokenizer (Lexer)
   - Tasks:
     - Break input into tokens (e.g., keywords, identifiers, operators, literals).
     - Handle whitespace and comments.
     - Assign token types for syntax parsing.

###  Parsing (Syntax Analysis)
   - Purpose: Converts tokens into a structured representation (Abstract Syntax Tree - AST).
   - Components: Parser
   - Tasks:
     - Validate grammar and syntax.
     - Construct an AST.
     - Handle syntax errors.

###  Semantic Analysis
   - Purpose: Ensures correct meaning and logical consistency.
   - Components: Semantic Analyzer
   - Tasks:
     - Type checking.
     - Scope and variable resolution.
     - Function and class validation.

###  Intermediate Representation (IR) Generation
   - Purpose: Converts AST into an optimized intermediate form.
   - Components: AST Transformer / IR Generator
   - Tasks:
     - Optimize structure for execution.
     - Convert to bytecode, three-address code, or another IR.

###  Optimization (Optional)
   - Purpose: Improve performance before execution.
   - Tasks:
     - Constant folding (precompute constants).
     - Dead code elimination.
     - Loop unrolling or function inlining.

###  Execution / Code Generation
   - Purpose: Convert IR into executable instructions.
   - Components: Interpreter or Compiler
   - Tasks:
     - Direct execution (Interpreter) or compilation to machine code.
     - Function call handling.
     - Memory management (garbage collection, if applicable).

###  Runtime Management
   - Purpose: Handles execution flow and resource management.
   - Tasks:
     - Stack and heap management.
     - Exception handling.
     - Input/Output operations.
