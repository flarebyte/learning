# How to Add Comments in Go

Go supports two types of comments:

### 1. **Single-line Comments**

Use `//` for comments that span a single line.

```go
// This is a single-line comment
fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
```

### 2. **Multi-line (Block) Comments**

Use `/* */` for comments that span multiple lines.

```go
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
Useful for longer explanations.
*/
fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
```

## Community Recommendations and Best Practices

### Use Comments for Documentation

- Document **packages**, **functions**, **types**, **constants**, and **variables** using comments immediately before their declarations.
- Go tools like `godoc` or `go doc` parse these comments into documentation.

```go
// Add adds two integers and returns the result.
func Add(a int, b int) int {
    return a + b
}
```

> ðŸ“Œ Best practice: The comment should begin with the name of the function/type being described (e.g., `Add adds...`).

### Avoid Redundant Comments

- Comments should add value or clarify intent. Don't restate what the code obviously does.

```go
// BAD: This comment is redundant
x := 10 // Set x to 10

// GOOD: Useful context
// Set x to 10, which is the default retry count
x := 10
```

### Use Comments to Explain _Why_, Not _What_

- Let the code explain **what** is being done.
- Use comments to explain **why** something is being done in a specific way, especially for non-obvious logic or hacks.

### Go Doc Comments Are Important

- For public APIs, Go documentation comments are critical.
- Tools like [`golint`](https://github.com/golang/lint) and [`staticcheck`](https://staticcheck.io/) enforce this style.

### Avoid Block Comments for Code Explanation

- Prefer single-line `//` comments even for longer explanations, placing them above the code block.
- Reserve `/* */` for disabling blocks of code or legal info.
