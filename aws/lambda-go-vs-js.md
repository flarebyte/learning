# AWS Lambda: Go vs Node.js

## Security point of view

| Category                     | Go (Golang)                             | Node.js                                 | Winner         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Runtime Security**         | Single compiled binary, minimal VM      | Requires Node runtime, JS engine        | ðŸŸ¢ Go          |
| **Dependency Management**    | Fewer dependencies, `go.sum` checks     | Heavy npm use, higher supply chain risk | ðŸŸ¢ Go          |
| **Memory Safety**            | Strong type safety, compile-time checks | Memory-safe but dynamic typing risks    | ðŸŸ¢ Go (slight) |
| **Cold Start Time**          | Very fast, minimal overhead             | Decent, but slower with large deps      | ðŸŸ¢ Go          |
| **Execution Predictability** | Deterministic, no implicit coercion     | Prone to runtime surprises              | ðŸŸ¢ Go          |
| **Ecosystem Maturity**       | Growing, stable standard lib            | Massive, with many serverless libs      | ðŸŸ¡ Node.js     |
| **Official AWS Support**     | Full support, including containers      | Full support, rich ecosystem            | âšª Tie         |

**âœ… Verdict:** Go offers stronger security and performance for AWS Lambda, especially in production environments.
