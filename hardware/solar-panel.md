## Solar Exposure in the UK

| Season               | Average Sunlight Hours/Day | Solar Irradiance (kWh/m²/day) | Notes                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Winter** (Dec–Feb) | 1–2 hrs/day                | 0.5–1.5                       | Low sun angle, short days, lots of cloud |
| **Spring** (Mar–May) | 3–5 hrs/day                | 2.5–4                         | Increasing daylight and clearer skies    |
| **Summer** (Jun–Aug) | 5–6.5 hrs/day              | 4.5–5.5                       | Best performance: long days and high sun |
| **Autumn** (Sep–Nov) | 2–4 hrs/day                | 2–3                           | Shortening days, some bright crisp days  |

> ☀️ **Annual average**: ~3.5–4.2 kWh/m²/day across most of the UK  
> Best regions: South-facing, low-shade areas (especially in the South of England)

## Types of Solar Panels – Pros, Cons & Best Uses

| Type                                 | Efficiency (%)                       | Pros                                                                      | Cons                                                     | Best For                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Monocrystalline (Mono)**           | 18–22%                               | High efficiency, sleek black look, compact for small roofs                | Slightly more expensive than poly                        | Homes with limited roof space                        |
| **Polycrystalline (Poly)**           | 15–17%                               | Cheaper upfront cost                                                      | Lower efficiency, blue appearance, needs more space      | Budget installs with lots of roof area               |
| **Bifacial (2-sided Mono)**          | 19–23% (front) + up to 30% rear gain | Extra output from reflected light, durable (glass-glass), cool aesthetics | Needs reflective surface & spacing, slightly higher cost | Ground mounts, white roofs, vertical installs        |
| **Thin-film (e.g. CdTe)**            | 10–13%                               | Flexible, lightweight, great in shade or high heat                        | Low efficiency, larger area needed, short lifespan       | Special use (campervans, curved surfaces, hot zones) |
| **Tandem/Perovskite (emerging)**     | 25–33% (lab)                         | Super high efficiency, can be combined with silicon (tandem cells)        | Not yet commercially available, still being tested       | Future tech / research / premium applications        |
| **BIPV / Solar Glass / Transparent** | 5–15% (varies)                       | Aesthetic, doubles as window/glass wall, clean integration                | Expensive, lower output, limited market availability     | Architects, modern homes, passive solar builds       |

## Summary Tips:

- **UK = good solar country** – because of long summer days and tech that works in diffuse light.
- For **typical homes**, monocrystalline or bifacial panels are best.
- If you have **lots of space** and want low cost → go for **poly**.
- For **aesthetic integration**, **BIPV or bifacial** (especially vertical) can be stylish _and_ smart.

## ☀️ Ideal Solar Panel Orientation – West Midlands (UK)

This table provides the **optimal tilt angle** (from horizontal) and **azimuth direction** (from North) for fixed solar panels throughout the year.

| June      | 29.5°                          | 180° (South)                 |
| July      | 31.5°                          | 180° (South)                 |
| August    | 38.5°                          | 180° (South)                 |
| September | 50.5°                          | 180° (South)                 |
| October   | 61.5°                          | 180° (South)                 |
| November  | 70.5°                          | 180° (South)                 |

> **Note**: A fixed tilt of around **35–40°** is a common compromise in the UK for year-round production if you don’t want to adjust the panels seasonally.
