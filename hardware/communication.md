# Communication protocols

A **communication protocol** between microcontrollers is a set of rules that defines how data is transmitted and received between devices, ensuring reliable and efficient communication. These protocols manage data formatting, synchronization, error detection, and handshaking to enable seamless interaction between microcontrollers and peripherals. Common protocols include **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)** for simple serial communication, **I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)** for multi-device communication using a shared two-wire bus, and **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)** for high-speed, full-duplex data transfer. These protocols help microcontrollers exchange data with sensors, memory modules, displays, and other devices in embedded systems.

## Overview of UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)

**UART** is a serial communication protocol used for transmitting and receiving data between microcontrollers and other devices. It operates asynchronously, meaning it does not require a clock signal; instead, it relies on start and stop bits to frame data packets. UART communication uses two main lines: **TX (transmit)** and **RX (receive)**, making it simple and efficient for short-distance communication.

### Pros of UART:

✅ **Simplicity** – Requires only two wires (TX and RX).  
✅ **Asynchronous Operation** – No need for an external clock signal.  
✅ **Error Checking** – Includes parity bits and stop bits to detect transmission errors.  
✅ **Widely Supported** – Found in almost all microcontrollers and embedded systems.

### Cons of UART:

❌ **Limited Speed** – Typically slower than SPI and I2C, with common baud rates up to 1 Mbps.  
❌ **Short Distance Communication** – Effective only over short distances (typically under 15 meters).  
❌ **One-to-One Communication** – Cannot directly support multiple devices on the same bus like I2C.  
❌ **Data Overhead** – Start and stop bits add extra bits per transmission, reducing efficiency.

UART is best suited for low-speed, simple communication in embedded systems, such as interfacing with sensors, GPS modules, and serial console debugging.

## Overview of I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)

**I²C** is a multi-master, multi-slave serial communication protocol that enables multiple devices to communicate over a shared two-wire bus. It consists of **SCL (Serial Clock Line)** and **SDA (Serial Data Line)**, where a master device controls the clock and initiates communication with slave devices using unique addresses. I²C is widely used in embedded systems for connecting peripherals like sensors, EEPROMs, and displays.

### Pros of I²C:

✅ **Multi-Device Support** – Allows multiple masters and slaves on the same bus.  
✅ **Reduced Wiring** – Only requires two lines (SCL & SDA), saving PCB space.  
✅ **Moderate Speed** – Supports standard (100 kbps), fast (400 kbps), and high-speed (up to 3.4 Mbps) modes.  
✅ **Built-in Acknowledgment** – Ensures data integrity by requiring slaves to acknowledge received data.

### Cons of I²C:

❌ **Slower than SPI** – Due to clock stretching and acknowledgment mechanisms.  
❌ **Limited Data Size** – Typically designed for small data transfers, making it inefficient for large payloads.  
❌ **Pull-up Resistors Required** – External resistors are needed on SCL and SDA lines for proper operation.  
❌ **More Complex than UART** – Uses addressing and handshaking, increasing software complexity.

I²C is ideal for connecting multiple low-speed peripherals within an embedded system, such as temperature sensors, real-time clocks (RTC), and OLED displays.

## Overview of SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)

**SPI** is a high-speed, full-duplex serial communication protocol used for data transfer between microcontrollers and peripherals. It operates using a master-slave architecture with four main lines: **MOSI (Master Out, Slave In)**, **MISO (Master In, Slave Out)**, **SCK (Serial Clock)**, and **SS (Slave Select)**. The master generates the clock signal, while the slave devices communicate based on chip select signals.

### Pros of SPI:

✅ **High-Speed Communication** – Supports speeds up to several MHz (faster than UART & I²C).  
✅ **Full-Duplex Data Transfer** – Allows simultaneous sending and receiving of data.  
✅ **Simple Hardware Implementation** – No need for pull-up resistors like I²C.  
✅ **Supports Multiple Slaves** – Can connect multiple devices with separate chip select lines.

### Cons of SPI:

❌ **Requires More Wires** – Needs at least four lines, plus an extra SS line for each additional slave.  
❌ **No Built-in Acknowledgment** – Unlike I²C, it lacks error-checking mechanisms.  
❌ **Limited Multi-Slave Support** – Each slave needs a separate SS line, which can be impractical for many devices.  
❌ **Short-Distance Communication** – Similar to UART, it is effective for short-range connections.

SPI is best suited for high-speed data transfer applications, such as interfacing with SD cards, TFT displays, ADCs, and real-time sensor data acquisition.

### RS-232: How It Fits into Microcontroller Communication

**RS-232** is a legacy serial communication standard that predates UART, SPI, and I²C but is still used in some embedded systems. It defines both the **electrical signaling and protocol** for serial data exchange over longer distances. RS-232 operates asynchronously, like **UART**, meaning it does not require a clock signal and uses start and stop bits to frame data. However, RS-232 differs from UART in **voltage levels** and **cabling requirements**.

### **How RS-232 Compares to UART, I²C, and SPI:**

## Enhancing Security for Weak Protocols in Microcontrollers

For protocols with **weak or no built-in security** (like **UART, SPI, I2C, RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, nRF24, and Sub-GHz RF**), security can be **improved at the software level** with additional layers while considering the **low speed** of these protocols. Here are some strategies:

### Data Encryption

Encrypting data before transmission ensures confidentiality, even if the communication is intercepted.

#### ✅ **Lightweight Encryption Algorithms**

- **AES-128 (Advanced Encryption Standard)**
  - Can be implemented in software with libraries like **TinyAES** (for low-power microcontrollers).
  - Works well with **I2C, SPI, and RS-485** but might be **too slow** for very low-speed protocols.
- **XOR Cipher**

  - **Extremely lightweight** but offers minimal security.
  - Can be used for **obfuscation** in low-speed systems like **RS-232** and **UART**.

- **Speck & Simon (Lightweight Encryption by NSA)**

  - Designed for constrained devices with better performance than AES.
  - Good for **I2C, SPI, and Sub-GHz RF** applications.

- **ChaCha20 (Stream Cipher)**
  - Faster than AES for software-based encryption.
  - Suitable for medium-speed protocols like **RS-485** and **nRF24L01**.

**💡 Best for:**  
✅ **SPI, I2C, RS-485, and nRF24L01** – Can handle simple AES-based security.  
🚫 **RS-232, Sub-GHz RF (HC-12)** – Might struggle with encryption due to **low speed**.

### Message Authentication & Integrity

Ensures that data is not altered or corrupted during transmission.

#### ✅ **HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)**

- Uses a **shared secret key** to generate a secure hash of the message.
- Common algorithms: **HMAC-SHA256, HMAC-MD5** (SHA256 is preferred).
- Good for preventing **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks** in **RS-485, I2C, and Sub-GHz RF**.

#### ✅ **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) & Checksum**

- **CRC-8, CRC-16, or CRC-32** can verify data integrity.
- Already used in **RS-485 and LoRa**, but **not secure** against intentional tampering.
- A **cryptographic hash (SHA-256)** adds security but requires **more CPU power**.

**💡 Best for:**  
✅ **RS-485, Sub-GHz RF, I2C** – Can use HMAC for **authentication**.  
✅ **UART, RS-232** – Can use **CRC + checksum** to prevent errors.

### Secure Key Exchange & Authentication

Before transmitting encrypted messages, devices need a **secure way to exchange encryption keys**.

#### ✅ **Pre-Shared Keys (PSK)**

- A **predefined secret key** is stored in both devices.
- Used in **LoRaWAN and Zigbee** for authentication.
- **Not scalable** for multiple devices.

#### ✅ **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (ECDH)**

- A secure way to establish a **shared secret** without prior key sharing.
- Works well for **SPI, I2C, and RS-485**, but might be **too slow** for **UART or RS-232**.

#### ✅ **Rolling Code Mechanism**

- Used in **garage door openers and keyless entry systems**.
- Prevents replay attacks by changing the key with every transmission.
- Useful for **Sub-GHz RF (HC-12, 433 MHz RF)**.

**💡 Best for:**  
✅ **RS-485, SPI, I2C** – Can use **ECDH** for key exchange.  
✅ **Sub-GHz RF, nRF24** – Can use **rolling codes**.

### Time-Based Security Measures

Adding **timing constraints** makes it harder for attackers to exploit weak protocols.

#### ✅ **Challenge-Response Authentication**

- The receiver sends a **random challenge**, and the sender must compute a response.
- Prevents **replay attacks** in **RS-485, I2C, and SPI**.

#### ✅ **Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)**

- Based on **synchronized timestamps** between devices.
- Used in **low-speed devices** like **RS-232 and Sub-GHz RF** to prevent **MITM attacks**.

**💡 Best for:**  
✅ **RS-485, I2C, Sub-GHz RF** – Can use **challenge-response** for secure authentication.

### Physical & Network-Level Security

Sometimes, **software security isn’t enough**—physical access to the hardware can be a risk.

#### ✅ **Secure Boot & Firmware Signing**

- Ensures that only **authorized firmware** runs on the microcontroller.
- Important for **RS-485-based industrial systems**.

#### ✅ **Disable Unused Interfaces**

- If a device isn’t using **UART, SPI, or I2C**, disable those ports in firmware.
- Prevents hardware-based attacks.

#### ✅ **Use Shielded Cables & Differential Signaling**

- **RS-485 and RS-422** use differential signaling, reducing noise and making it harder to **inject signals**.
- **For I2C and SPI**, **shorter traces** and **shielding** can help.

| **nRF24**      | AES-128 / XOR            | Rolling Codes       | CRC-16           | Use **packet acknowledgment and encryption**        |
| **Sub-GHz RF** | XOR / AES (Slow)         | Rolling Codes       | CRC-16           | Use **challenge-response, key rotation**            |

**Final Thoughts**
For microcontrollers using **weak protocols**, these are the best **realistic security measures**:

- **Use lightweight encryption (AES-128, XOR, or ChaCha20) when speed allows**.
- **Authenticate messages with HMAC, CRC, or rolling codes** to prevent spoofing.
- **Ensure secure key exchange** with pre-shared keys or Diffie-Hellman.
- **Limit physical access** and use **secure boot and firmware signing**.

If power and processing constraints are critical, **simple techniques like CRC + rolling codes + challenge-response authentication** can significantly improve security **without slowing down communication**.
