# L-System

## What is an L-System (Lindenmayer System)?

An **L-system** is a rule-based system for generating sequences of symbols (usually strings) that simulate growth â€” originally for modeling plant development. Think of it as a **rewrite engine**: you start with an initial string (`axiom`) and apply rules (`productions`) that replace symbols with other strings, step by step.

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts:

- **Axiom**: Starting string. Like `"A"`.
- **Rules**: Dictate how each character is transformed. For example, `"A" â†’ "AB"`, `"B" â†’ "A"`.
- **Iterations**: Each step rewrites the entire string based on the rules.

```python
axiom = "A"
rules = {
    "A": "AB",
    "B": "A"
}
```

Each iteration rewrites the string according to the rules. After a few steps, the string grows into something like: `"ABAABABA..."`

## What is an Extended L-System?

**Extended L-systems** take the original concept and **add more structure or logic**, making them more flexible and programmable. These extensions often include:

1. **Parameterized L-systems** â€“ where symbols can have parameters (like function calls).
2. **Context-sensitive L-systems** â€“ rules can depend on neighboring symbols.
3. **Stochastic L-systems** â€“ introduce randomness to rules.
4. **Functional or procedural L-systems** â€“ symbols can represent actions, like turtle graphics (drawing), or even contain Python-like logic.

```python
# A symbol with parameters
rules = {
    "F(x)": lambda x: f"F({x+1})G({x-1})" if x > 0 else ""
}
```
