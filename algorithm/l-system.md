# L-System

## What is an L-System (Lindenmayer System)?

An **L-system** is a rule-based system for generating sequences of symbols (usually strings) that simulate growth â€” originally for modeling plant development. Think of it as a **rewrite engine**: you start with an initial string (`axiom`) and apply rules (`productions`) that replace symbols with other strings, step by step.

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts:

- **Axiom**: Starting string. Like `"A"`.
- **Rules**: Dictate how each character is transformed. For example, `"A" â†’ "AB"`, `"B" â†’ "A"`.
- **Iterations**: Each step rewrites the entire string based on the rules.

```python
axiom = "A"
rules = {
    "A": "AB",
    "B": "A"
}
```

Each iteration rewrites the string according to the rules. After a few steps, the string grows into something like: `"ABAABABA..."`

## What is an Extended L-System?

**Extended L-systems** take the original concept and **add more structure or logic**, making them more flexible and programmable. These extensions often include:

1. **Parameterized L-systems** â€“ where symbols can have parameters (like function calls).
2. **Context-sensitive L-systems** â€“ rules can depend on neighboring symbols.
3. **Stochastic L-systems** â€“ introduce randomness to rules.
4. **Functional or procedural L-systems** â€“ symbols can represent actions, like turtle graphics (drawing), or even contain Python-like logic.

```python
# A symbol with parameters
rules = {
    "F(x)": lambda x: f"F({x+1})G({x-1})" if x > 0 else ""
}
```

## L-System with Graphs (Graph-Based L-System)

### Concept:

Instead of representing the system as a string of characters, we use a **graph** where:

- **Nodes** represent entities (e.g. branches, leaves, junctions).
- **Edges** represent relationships or connections between entities.
- **Rules** apply to **subgraphs or nodes** and generate new nodes or modify structure.

This is closer to how real-life growth works (e.g., a plant node splits into branches, not into characters).

## Key Components

| Component       | Description                                                      | Example (Python-ish)                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `graph`         | The current structure â€“ usually a `dict` or graph object         | `graph[node] = [child1, child2]`                |
| `node`          | A unit with attributes (like type, age, angle, etc.)             | `{"type": "branch", "length": 2}`               |
| `rule(node)`    | A function that returns changes (e.g., new nodes or connections) | `if node["type"] == "tip": grow new branches()` |
| `apply_rules()` | Walk through nodes and apply growth rules                        | Loop over graph, apply rule per node            |

## Example Structure (in pseudo-Python)

```python
graph = {
    0: {"type": "root", "children": [1, 2]},
    1: {"type": "tip", "children": []},
    2: {"type": "tip", "children": []}
}

def growth_rule(node_id, graph):
    node = graph[node_id]
    if node["type"] == "tip":
        new_id = max(graph) + 1
        graph[new_id] = {"type": "tip", "children": []}
        node["children"].append(new_id)
        node["type"] = "branch"
```

Each iteration modifies the graph by **adding nodes** and **updating connections** based on the rules. You can visualize this as a growing tree with nodes branching out.
