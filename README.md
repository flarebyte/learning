## Purpose

The materials in this repository serve as:

- Personal reference notes for developers.
- A foundation for internal documentation and developer onboarding.
- A structured reading base for learning and cross-domain exploration.

Each document is intended to be standalone, providing both conceptual clarity and implementation insights without requiring deep prior context.
