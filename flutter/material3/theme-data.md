# Theme data

`ThemeData` in Flutter is a configuration class that centralizes visual styling and layout properties across an app, enabling consistent theming. It defines attributes such as colors, typography, shapes, padding, and component styles for various widgets, like buttons, text fields, and dialogs.

By using `ThemeData`, you can establish both light and dark themes, set primary and accent colors, customize text styles, and apply global widget styling. `ThemeData` can be combined with `Theme.of(context)` to access and apply theme properties throughout the widget tree, ensuring uniform styling and simplifying theme switching and maintenance.

## Bespoke theme

To create a bespoke theme with `ThemeData`, you should define:

1. **Color Scheme**: Customize `primaryColor`, `accentColor`, `backgroundColor`, and `errorColor` for consistent coloring.
2. **Typography**: Set custom `TextTheme` for headings, body, captions, etc., to standardize font styles.
3. **Component Themes**: Specify styles for components like `AppBarTheme`, `ButtonTheme`, `InputDecorationTheme`, and `CardTheme`.
4. **Shape and Elevation**: Customize `shape` properties (e.g., rounded corners) and elevation for widgets like buttons and dialogs.
5. **Padding and Margin**: Adjust `visualDensity` and spacing attributes for refined layout adjustments.

This configuration ensures a unique, consistent look and feel across the app.
